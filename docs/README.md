# onos-gui project
GUI for ONOS (µONOS Architecture).

onos-gui is the GUI application for all of the GUI functionality of µONOS.

It will provide GUI interfaces for all of the core projects such as

* [onos-config](config-gui.md)
* onos-topo
* onos-control

In the first iteration (Sep '19) the Configuration GUI is the main target, but generally
the architecture will support UI extensions for any project, as libraries.

## Architecture
See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for an architectural discussion.

## Running the GUI

* [prerequisites.md](prerequisites.md) has instructions on how to install
the necessary tools.
* [run.md](run.md) has instructions how to run the GUI.
