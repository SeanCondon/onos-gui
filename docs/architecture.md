# onos-gui Architecture
The GUI is architected as a Cloud Native application to be run on Kubernetes
accessing the back end modules through gRPC (and in the case of the Config GUI
mostly through gNMI).

The main front end technology is [Angular](https://angular.io) and is
supplemented by [gRPC Web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web) to access the back
through a gRPC proxy.

[Nginx](https://nginx.org/) acts as a web server and web Proxy, while
[Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) proxy server acts as a grpc-web proxy and
all are deployed on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community/open-source) or
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

While 2 proxies seem to be an overhead, it is unavoidable at present because:

* nginx cannot do the grpc-web proxying (while there was a
[module](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web/tree/master/net/grpc/gateway/nginx) written for
nginx in the grpc-web project, this [does not work](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web/issues/372#issuecomment-438045235)
with anything beyond nginx v1.14.2)

* Envoy cannot load static web pages, and so nginx is required to perform this role

## Alternatives to grpc-web
There are some alternatives to using grpc-web to allow web browsers to access
gRPC directly, but grpc-web is the recommended solution as per the gRPC [website](https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/web/).
